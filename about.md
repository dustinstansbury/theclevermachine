This blog is an attempt to distill some of the knowledge I’ve gained through my experiences as a former computational neursocientist and current data scientist.

The content of the blog will be posts about statistics, machine learning, analysis techniques, algorithms, theory--basically stuff that I find cool,  exciting, or helpful. 

I plan for a majority of posts to be based around a source code implementation of whatever it is I’m trying to explain (which can potentially be somewhat formal). I have found that making direct connections between theory and implementation is incredibly useful for gaining incite into technical concepts. Implementations are usually in python 3 because of its simple syntax and robust set of data science tools. However, I may sprinkle in some other examples in languages such as `bash`, `SQL`, `Docker`, etc. Some additional content will be modern pythonized posts from the [original TheCleverMachine blog](https://theclevermachine.wordpress.com/), which used MATLAB for demonstrations (*ah, academia*).

I hope that you find the blog useful, and any comments, suggestions, or suggested topics are welcome and greatly appreciated.
